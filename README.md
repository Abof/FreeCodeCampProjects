# FreeCodeCampProjects
Let me present you a repository of projects which I made during [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) (`FCC`). 
I'll also include them in my `FCC` protfolio project; [check it out](https://abof.github.io/FreeCodeCampProjects/) online (or on `gh-pages` branch)!

## GitHub vs CodePen
I'll store sources of mentioned projects here on GitHub but - what is required in `FCC` - I'll store them also on my [CodePen profile](http://codepen.io/Abof/).
